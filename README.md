#Source Sans Pro

##Overview
Source Sans Pro is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed to work well
in user interface (UI) environments. In addition to a functional OpenType font, this open
source project provides all of the source files that were used to build this OpenType font
by using the AFDKO makeotf tool.

###Notes
We recently changed the name of the repo from Source-Sans-Pro to source-sans-pro. 
If you have already cloned the repo, you will need to run this command:

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro.git`

##Getting Involved
Send suggestions for changes to the Source Sans OpenType font project maintainer,
phunt@adobe.com, for consideration.
